# Tread Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Basic user authentication and profile creation
- Text editor for creating and publishing threads
- Commenting system for discussion
- Basic search functionality for finding threads
- Mobile responsive design

### Goals for Phase 1:
- User authentication and profile creation: In order to use the site, users will need to create an account and log in. This will allow us to personalize their experience and enable features such as bookmarking and saving drafts.
- Thread creation and publishing: The core functionality of Tread is allowing users to create and publish their writing projects as threads. A simple text editor will be provided for users to input their writing.
- Commenting system: A commenting system will be implemented to allow for discussion and feedback on writing projects.
- Basic search functionality: Users should be able to search for threads based on keywords and tags.
- Mobile responsive design: With more and more users accessing the web via mobile devices, it's important to ensure Tread is accessible and easy to use on a variety of screen sizes.

## Phase 2: Collaboration Tools
- Add a "Collaborators" section for user collaboration on writing projects
- Implement a Git-like version control system for writing projects
- Allow users to create and manage branches for their writing projects
- Add the ability to tag users and send notifications to them for collaboration

### Goals for Phase 2:
- Collaboration tools: To make Tread a hub for collaborative writing projects, it's important to have features that facilitate this. The "Collaborators" section will enable users to invite others to work on their projects. The Git-like version control system will make it easy to track changes and merge updates from collaborators.
- Branching system: Like Git, users should be able to create and manage branches for their writing projects. This will enable them to experiment with different versions of their work, or to work on separate sections simultaneously.
- Tagging and notifications: In order to streamline collaboration, users should be able to tag other users in comments and discussions, and receive notifications when they are mentioned.

## Phase 3: NFT Integration
- Add the ability for users to convert their writing projects and threads into NFTs
- Integrate with a blockchain-based marketplace for buying and selling NFTs
- Allow users to bid on and sell their writing projects as NFTs

### Goals for Phase 3:
- NFT integration: As NFTs gain in popularity, allowing users to convert their writing projects and threads into NFTs for sale on a marketplace is an exciting possibility.
- Blockchain integration: To enable the creation and sale of NFTs, Tread will need to integrate with a blockchain-based marketplace.
- Bidding system: To enable users to buy and sell NFTs, Tread will need to have a bidding system in place. Users should be able to place bids on NFTs, and the highest bidder should win the NFT.

## Phase 4: Additional Features
- Add a Twitter-like threading system for regular posts by users
- Implement a hashtag system for organizing and searching threads
- Add a bookmarking system for users to save and follow threads
- Implement an upvote/downvote system for rating threads
- Allow users to create private threads for collaboration with select individuals

### Goals for Phase 4:
- Twitter-like threading system: To allow for more casual writing and discussion, Tread should also allow users to create shorter, Twitter-like posts in addition to longer writing projects.
- Hashtag system: To make it easier to organize and search for threads, Tread should implement a hashtag system.
- Bookmarking system: Users should be able to save and follow threads for easy
